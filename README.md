### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


"I am a motivated and enthusiastic learner, currently pursuing a degree in AI in software engineering technology. My goal is to become a skilled AI developer and make a difference in the world with my knowledge and skills. I am eager to explore new technologies, work on interesting projects, and collaborate with others. My Github account is a place for me to share my progress and connect with like-minded individuals. I am excited for the future and all the possibilities it holds. Let's learn and grow together!"

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript, MySQL and Bash. My journey to AI consists of many questions I need answers to, therefore, I'm an information sponge.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with building an outstanding portfolio website.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, I'd love to have a chat!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I learned more from breaking things - crying about breaking them, and then fixing it :)

So... about that chat, you can reach me here!
